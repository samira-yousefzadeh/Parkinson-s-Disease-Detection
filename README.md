# Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on the early detection of **Parkinson's Disease** using machine learning techniques. It uses a dataset of biomedical voice measurements and trains classification models to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's disease.

## Project Structure

- `PD.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
- `Parkinsson disease.csv` â€“ Dataset of voice measurements used for model training.
- `LICENSE` â€“ MIT License file for open-source distribution.
- `README.md` â€“ Project overview and documentation (you are here).

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes biomedical voice measurements from people with and without Parkinsonâ€™s disease.  
It contains features such as:
- Average vocal fundamental frequency
- Jitter and shimmer measures
- Harmonic-to-noise ratio
- Recurrence period density entropy
- Spread, D2, and PPE

**Target Column:** `status`  
- `1` = Parkinson's Disease  
- `0` = Healthy Control
